### Technologies

- [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

### Resources and details
This is a wordpress Plugin I wrote to place the publish button in the toolbar because quite frankly it's a pain in the ass to have to scroll up all the time to when you're on a long page/post have a lot of categories or tags and then the publish button is out of the window.

### How to install this
#### If you don't have a Wordpress Instance
- Clone this Repo
- Download and install docker
- Open Terminal
- Navigate to the folder this is located in
- Type `docker-compose up -d` and press enter
#### If you have a Wordpress Instance already
- Check out the `README.md` over on the [dedicated plugin repo](https://github.com/daltonjmcgee/toolbar_publish/tree/1.0.3).
